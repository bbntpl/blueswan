# Blueswan seafood restaurant page
It's a super simple restaurant website made with JS and CSS. I developed this as a project during my early stages of learning web development through [TOP](https://theodinproject.com) along with this project [The Traveler's Cafe](https://github.com/bvrbryn445/travelers-cafe).


### What is Blueswan?

Blueswan is the name of a seafood restaurant inspired by the musical track "Blue Swan 5" by Infected Mushroom.

### What defines the website's theme?

The theme is an inspiration from One Piece (OP), a Japanese Manga series written by Eiichiro Oda. Althought, direct references to OP are not explicitly displayed, the website incorporates visual elements related to the sea, a significant setting in OP.

Furthermore, the website isn't intended to have a modernized look. I've chosen to create two distinct projects under the same purpose: one embracing a modern aesthetic and the other adopting an older website design.

### Why release this website to the public?

I don't know, tbh. Perhapts it's because One Piece Netflix series is scheduled for release tomorrow.
